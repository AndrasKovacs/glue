This repository contains some experiments with giving various (dependent)
models of type theory in internal languages of other models.

The project is on hold now, it's also bit out-of-date, as the definition of weak morphism could be dramatically streamlined.

The [Canonicity](Canonicity) folder contains a largely complete proof of canonicity for the syntax; there isn't any internal language magic intended there, it's just given as a normal model in Agda.
